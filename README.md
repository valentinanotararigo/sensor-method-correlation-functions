# sensor-method-correlation-functions

This code computes the power spectrum and the frequency- and time-resolved correlation functions of a two-level emitter in resonance with a cavity mode and coupled to it, using the sensor method. The system is described by a Linblad master equation, which involves incoherent pumping of the emitter and loss from the cavity and the atom. The analysis is carried out in the steady state condition.

The following figure represents the power spectra for different values of the damping of the mode:
